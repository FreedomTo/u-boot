Google Test
Build Status

Welcome to Google Test, Google's C++ test framework!

This repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

Please see the project page above for more information as well as the mailing list for questions, discussions, and development. There is also an IRC channel on OFTC (irc.oftc.net) #gtest available. Please join us!

Google Mock is an extension to Google Test for writing and using C++ mock classes. See the separate Google Mock documentation.

More detailed documentation for googletest (including build instructions) are in its interior googletest/README.md file.
